# Onboarding

You can use any user name and password to login (as long as the password matches the characters required)
I didn't get the chance to focus too much on UX/Design, as the requirements mentioned no use of any CSS framework. This made it a bit time consuming but I tried to focus on archeticture, robustness, usability and effeciency.
